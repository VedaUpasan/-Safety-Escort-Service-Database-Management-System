# Safety-Escort-Service-Database-Management-System

## Problem Statement:
Safe night transportation is the biggest challenge for off-campus students especially who are
living far away from campus, Unsafe and insecure feelings drive their minds wherein they
cannot dedicate long hours at the campus which not only negatively impacts their overall
well-being and academic performance. The current off-campus safety escort service, RedEye,
facilitates the students to book their rides only at the time of travel. Though this feature is useful,
it does have its share of inconsistencies. There would be many students booking the rides at odd
hours which may create a panic situation in the minds of the students. Due to overcrowding,
there would be rush and long waiting hours. There is also a lack of complete utilization of
resources which can be improved with additional features such as picking up students who want
to come to college at odd hours.

## Proposal:
The proposed solution is to enhance the RedEye off-campus safety escort service by adding a
pre-booking feature. This will allow students to book their rides in advance, as per scheduled
class work timings instead of booking after the class work. By doing so, students can have peace
of mind knowing that they have a safe mode of transportation at night, without having to worry
about booking a ride at the last minute.
In addition to the existing features of the RedEye App, a new pre-booking feature will be added,
which makes advance bookings easier for students at their convenience. Furthermore, a pick-up
option will be introduced where while dropping students off, students who are situated close to
the drop-off points can take advantage of the ride going back to college, which can help students
to travel at odd times to college for multiple reasons such as RSO proctor traveling for their
midnight shift.


## Benefits:
1. Improved safety and security for students who live off-campus
2. Increased convenience for students who have fixed schedules
3. Increased peace of mind for students who can book rides in advance
4. Reduced stress and anxiety for students who no longer have to worry about finding safe transportation at night

The proposed solution will provide students with a more convenient and reliable off-campus
safety escort service, ensuring their safety and well-being. By implementing this proposal,
students can feel confident and secure when traveling at night, which will have a positive impact
on their overall academic performance and well-being.
